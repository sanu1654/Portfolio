            Throughout my academic journey, I've undertaken a series of impactful projects
            showcasing my expertise in various domains. In a testament to my creativity and technical skills, I
            designed and developed my own portfolio website from scratch. This project not only showcases my
            proficiency in web development technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript but also a user-friendly
            space that I designed with creativity and simplicity in mind.

                    <h3>Multi-Purpose Autonomous Robot</h3>
                    <p>In my Degree Minor project, as a part of a
                        three-member team, I actively contributed to the creation of a remarkable robotic system titled
                        the
                        "Multi-Talented Robot." This innovative project serves as a testament to a wide array of
                        intelligent
                        functionalities, featuring obstacle avoidance, auto path following, and human hand trackingâ€”all
                        seamlessly controllable through an intuitive mobile application.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the development process, I harnessed the power of an Arduino UNO microcontroller,
                        incorporating
                        advanced sensors and a Bluetooth module for convenient mobile connectivity.This project
                        is the sophisticated integration of cutting-edge sensors, including ultrasonic and infrared
                        sensors,
                        L298N motor drivers, and servo motors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The standout capabilities of this project include its ability to autonomously navigate and avoid
                        obstacles through the obstacle avoidance mode, making it ideal for automated environments. The
                        auto
                        path following mode enables the robot to adeptly track predefined paths, demonstrating its
                        potential
                        in areas like warehouse logistics. Additionally, the human hand following mode adds an
                        interactive
                        dimension, as the robot can detect and pursue a user's hand.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Its practical applications extend to diverse fields, encompassing robotics research, industrial
                        automation, and human-robot interaction. This design allows the robot to be wirelessly operated
                        and
                        adapted for versatile applications, ranging from household scenarios to use in restaurants and
                        hospitals. For more details

        <p>
            For my degree's Major Project, I developed an <b>Intelligent Multi-Camera Surveillance System</b>, designed to
            redefine security standards through the use of advanced technology. The system utilizes the YOLOv8 module in
            Python for state-of-the-art object detection, segmentation, and tracking, ensuring accurate and efficient
            surveillance. OpenCV was integrated to enable real-time frame processing and display, while the capabilities
            of the system were further enhanced using the Ultralytics package. A key feature of this project is its
            multi-streaming functionality, achieved through the threading module, which allows simultaneous tracking
            across multiple camera feeds. This intelligent surveillance system represents a significant step forward in
            security technology by offering comprehensive object tracking and real-time analysis across various camera
            streams.
        </p>


        <p>

            In addition
            to these projects, I have worked on several intersting projects including a Spelling Corrector Application
            with a
            user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter in Python and many more mini projects as part of my lab
            work. Each project reflects my commitment to innovation, problem-solving, and the application of technology
            to real-world challenges.
